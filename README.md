Hi, I’m Max 👋  
*"I enjoy understanding how things work — and making them work better."*

I’m a junior **Web / Software Developer** transitioning into full-stack development, with a background in IT support and technical troubleshooting.

In my previous roles, I worked closely with systems, networks, and end users — which sparked my interest in how software is built, structured, and maintained behind the scenes.  
That curiosity grew into a career shift: I’m currently completing the **TripleTen Full-Stack Development program**, building real projects using modern web technologies and object-oriented JavaScript.

I’m focused on developing strong fundamentals, writing clean code, and building applications that are practical, reliable, and easy to maintain.
